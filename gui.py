# Cafe-- In cafe you order a pizza .. but it makes coffee instances and tea, but don't make pizzas.
# they offera service.. they order a pizza from third party..from a pizza shop nearby.
# python doesnot have window object by7 default.. but we can get those object instance from other third parties
# PySimpleGUI => Pizza shop, Window("My to-do App") => actual pizza instance, "My to do App" => what pizza do you want

# layout is an argument and it expects a list... a list of object instances, buttons, textboxes.
# [[_._._]] => the items you put in inner square brackets will be placed in one row
# [[][]] => two rows with one item each.
# [[_ , _], [_]]  => row1 col2, row2 col1.
# [[_],[_,_]] => roq1 col1, row2 col2
# [[_],[_],[_]] => 2 rows > list of three lists.
